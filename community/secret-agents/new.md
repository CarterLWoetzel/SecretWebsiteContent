Greetings, Secret Agent Recruit!

By becoming a Secret Agent you are committing to becoming a defender of privacy and an advocate for our ecosystem and community. Successful decentralized movements are built by people like you, communicating and collaborating towards a common goal. The value of a protocol like Secret Network is backed by the size and robustness of its community of believers and builders.

To get started, complete the "New Agent Registration" form below to sign up as an official Secret Agent and watch the 60-second video to understand the visions of values of Secret Network. Once you have completed these onboarding tasks, head over to the "Training Grounds" to get educated about the project and "Mission Control" to see how you can begin ranking up as a Secret Agent by completing missions to help us improve our market presence and grow our community!
