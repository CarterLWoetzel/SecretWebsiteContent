## Training Grounds

</template>

SECTION
Intro

These training grounds act as a safe, quick place for our agents to learn about Secret Network. We believe every agent is talented in their own way, so we have prepared resources and learning materials for both our Field Agents (non-devs) and Cryptologists (developers). 

Field Agents will be prepared with enough information to be dangerous on social media and Cryptologists will be equipped with information needed to get started building 'secret' smart contracts. Remember, this is a resource to empower you, so please don't feel intimidated. If you have questions, come join us over at the Education channel on Discord and ask away!
